# ADS-DoublyLinkedList
 [Algorithms and Data Structures] Manage and create doubly linked list in Pascal.  
 The program creates a doubly linked list based on record type elements.  
  
Procedures developed:
- adding an item to a doubly linked list in key order (last name)
- adding an element to a doubly linked list while maintaining the order of the key (name) along with checking if an identical element is already in the list
- removing the first item with the given key value
- removing all items with the given key value
- editing the selected item of the doubly linked list
- saving to the text file elements of the doubly linked list based on selected criteria (all elements of the list, elements with the selected name, adults)
- output doubly linked list content to the screen
- output the contents of the previously created text file to the screen.
   
 Program written in Lazarus 1.8.2 64bit.
